Very basic game:
Global class for adding and subtracting colors from your color - handled in Your Color instead
Logic to end the game when you get close enough to the target color - done
Left and right click handling for averaging/replacing  your color - done
Global variables to handle the main color's color and your color's color - handled through signals instead - done

Prototype:
Change randomness to be better (alternate light and dark colors, ensure starting color and main color are different enough)
Better color_circle spawn location logic - done 
Removal of color_circles after go off screen or after x time - done
Change win con to make more sense - done
Timer

Red, green, and blue static colors to get to the right color (race for mult, puzzle for single player)

Multiplayer = matching race, blue + red + green race, a bunch of colors pop up and move and you have to choose the one that exactly matches
Single player = Cozy puzzle thing

Colors could pop up and you can choose how much or what property of it you want to add maybe?

To do:
Change randomness to be better (alternate light and dark colors, ensure starting color and main color are different enough, better random spawners)
PuzzleRace mode - which of the 3 colors makes the player color the main color?
QuickMatch mode - which of the colors makes the player color the main color? - gets harder as you go further (less time, more colors, etc.)
	QuickMatch: keep level counter, at x levels, have a message go on screen that says how it's harder (Faster!, More options!)
