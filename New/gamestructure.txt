Structure:
	Scene: Main - in charge of managing moving from the main scene to the actual game
		Scene: Main scene UI - within scene navigation
			Credits
			Settings
			Single Player
			Multi Player
	Scene: Main Single Player Game scene - in charge of loading and unloading mini game scenes, overall game logic, orchestration
		Scene: Pause Menu - in charge of showing and hiding the pause menu, handling pause menu scenes
		Scene: GamePlay UI - in charge of showing relevant score information, navigating to different levels (?)
		Scene: Mini Game Scene - in charge of managing mini game logic, starting and ending mini games - structured like it's own game
			Each mini game should be self containing with understanding it's own starting and ending
	Scene: Main MultiPlayer Game scene - no clue how to do this
		No idea
	Util:
		SignalBus (Global) - in charge of managing larger signals between games
		SFXDeconstructor (Global) - manage SFX
		MiniGame Util helper (class) - handle calculations of each minigame so I don't have to reuse code
		Game Data - idk how to do this well
		
		
GameIdeas:
	Long Simon says (long strings of colors they have to click in the other screen (memory)) - prototyped
	Short Simon says (GIves you color have to press correct color quickly (time-based)) - prototyped
	Quick match (give starting color and end color and pick color in between to get there)
	Physics based launchpad to the correct color
	Carnival hammer to right color
	Color wave (everything on screen gets "hit" with a color and you have to pick the option that was the correct color before)
	River flow
	Maze based game
	Shoot the right enemy based on color
	Memory (remember the color pairs) -in scope
	
	Add juice - in scope - prio 3
	Add difficulty scaling -in scope - prio 2 - 
	Complete gameplay loop - in scope - prio 1 - done(enough)
	
	Done with all in scope items by 2/15
	
	
	Immediate TODOs:
		Add sounds to the game when you select option, when you win, when you lose
		Add some background music (don't care about it too much)
		Figure out the outlines of the color circles to make it look nicer
		Fix the random color generation logic problem
